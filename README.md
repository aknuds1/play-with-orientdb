In order to use OrientDB from Play (2.1) you need to &nbsp;do the following:

1. Execute
        git clone git@github.com:ratcashdev/play-with-orientdb.git
    to a subfolder under your Play 2.x installation.
2. Issue "play publish-local" from the play-with-orientdb/src/ folder


Next in the project that will use this plugin, do the following:

1. Add

        "ratcash.net" % "play-with-orientdb_2.10" % "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
    to your Build.scala, under appDependencies (more here ﻿﻿[lg:Working with Play 2.x Plugins])
2. Disable EBean in you Build.scala file
3. Edit

        conf/play.plugins
    to include:

        10000:modules.orientdb.ODBPlugin
4. if you would like to connect to remote databases, you'll also need to download and install OrientDB itself and create a *remote:local/<YourDBName>* database in it.
5. Copy the src/conf/db.config file from the plugin to the project's /conf folder that is going to use the plugin (this is only needed if you'll use embedded OrientDB database, i.e. local or memory)
6. Finally, add the following to your conf/application.conf

        # OrientDB configuration
        # ~~~~~
        #orientdb.db.url = "remote:localhost/MyDB"
        orientdb.db.url = "memory:temp"
        #orientdb.db.username = "admin"
        #orientdb.db.password = "admin"
        #orientdb.db.graph.url = "memory:temp"
        orientdb.db.config.file = "/conf/db.config"
        orientdb.db.entities.package = "models.*"
        orientdb.db.open-in-vieww.documentdb = "true"
        orientdb.db.open-in-vieww.objectdb = "true"
        orientdb.db.open-in-vieww.graphdb = "true"

*NOTE:* Play 2.1-RC1 can't currently do 'publish-local' when there's no ROUTES file, but when there is one (in the plugin), then it overrides the application-specific routes. Probably this will only work in the final 2.1 framework.
